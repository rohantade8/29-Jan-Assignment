        "Inheritance: This is a mechanism where an object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object. This allows you to create new classes that are built upon existing classes, and reuse or modify the existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading, where a single method can perform multiple operations based on the context in which it is used."
